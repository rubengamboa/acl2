; Added by Matt K., 12/5/2014: The proof seemed to take very long (forever?)
; today (I don't know why), but it succeeds quickly with the following
; additional disables.  Actually only one of these needs to be disabled, but
; compared to disabling both, the proof takes about 10x longer if only the
; second is enabled and about 27x as long if only the first is enabled.
