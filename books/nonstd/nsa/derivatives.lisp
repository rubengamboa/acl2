;; OK now, we want to prove the mean-value theorem.  We can actually
;; use the usual (not based on nsa) proof of this fact.  The trick is
;; to use Rolle's theorem on a new function rdfn2 that's chosen so
;; that rdfn2 vanishes at both a and b.  The function is given by rdfn
;; minus the line that goes from (a,(rdfn a)) to (b,(rdfn b)).
;; Because of this choice, when the derivative of rdfn2 is zero -- and
;; the existence of such a point in (a,b) is given by Rolle's theorem
;; -- it folloes that the derivative of rdfn is the same as the slope
;; of the line from (a,(rdfn a)) to (b,(rdfn b)).  I.e., that point
;; satisfies the requirement of the mean value theorem.

;; First, we offer the definition of the function rdfn2.  Notice, the
;; function depends on the actual points a and b.  So, we use the
;; encapsulated range above.  The statement of Rolle's theorem was
;; more general, in that the range [a,b] was placed in the hypothesis,
;; instead of an encapsulate.  Unfortunately, we can't do that here,
;; because the function definition needs to know the values of a and b
;; (and we can't just pass them down, because we need to guarantee
;; that (rdfn2 x) is standard when x is standard, but since we use a
;; and b in the definition, that wouldn't be the case if a and b were
;; non-standard -- and if we explicitly check for that in the
;; definition, then the function becomes non-classical!  Yikes!  There
;; has to be an easier way.
