arb-merge1.lisp: a simple, combinational arbitrated merge joint
arb-merge1.

arb-merge2.lisp: a more complex, sequential arbitrated merge joint
arb-merge2 that supports fairness.

interl1.lisp: a circuit family, interl1, that connects two instances
of Q20' to the two input ports of arb-merge1.

interl2.lisp: a circuit family, interl2, that connects two instances
of Q20' to the two input ports of arb-merge2.

interl-ll.lisp: a circuit family, interl-ll, that connects Q9' and
Q11' to the two input ports of arb-merge2.  It is designed as a left
half-complex link.

igcd1.lisp: a circuit family, igcd1, that concatenates interl1 and gcd.

igcd2.lisp: a circuit family, igcd2, that concatenates interl2 and gcd.

comp-interl1.lisp: a circuit family, comp-interl1, that connects the
outputs from two instances of interl1 to the inputs of a third
instance of interl1.

comp-interl2.lisp: a circuit family, comp-interl2, that connects the
outputs from two instances of interl2 to the inputs of a third
instance of interl2.

comp-interl.lisp: a circuit family, comp-interl, that connects the
outputs from two instances of interl2 to the inputs of an instance of
interl-ll.
