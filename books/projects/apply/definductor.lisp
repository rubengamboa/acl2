; This book provides a preliminary attempt at the definductor utility, which
; attempts to create an inductive hint function to associate with a
; loop$-recursive function.  At the moment we can only handle functions whose
; recursive loop$s all target a measured variable or cdr-nests of measured
; variables.  We can handle AS loop$s over such variables.  But we cannot
; handle functions containing recursive loop$s like

; (loop$ for e in (target x) collect ...)

; even when x is a measured variable.  Nor can we handle ON loop$s or
; FROM/TO/BY loop$s because their targets are (TAILS ...) and (FROM-TO-BY ...)
; expressions.  But it is a start!

; Invariant about mvars and alist: In this code, mvars starts out as the list
; of measured formals when we start to analyze the body of a function, and
; alist is nil.  As we dive into loop$s we extend mvars with the iterative
; variable(s) of the loop$, provided the target is a cdr-nest around an element
; of mvars.  We also extend alist by pairing the iterative variable with the
; CAR of the target, except we first ``resolve'' the target by applying the
; alist to it.  Thus, the alist always maps iterative varibles in mvars to the
; car/cdr-nests denoting the first value the iterative variable takes on,
; expressed entirely in terms of the original formals.  Thus, if at the
; top-level of a fn's body, where the (original) mvars is just the list (x),
; then we get to alpha in (loop$ for e in (cdr x) collect alpha), mvars is (e
; x) and alist is ((e . (car (cdr x)))).  If alpha is (loop$ for d in (cdr (cdr
; e)) collect beta), then when we see beta mvars is (d e x) and alist is ((d
; . (car (cdr (cdr (car (cdr x)))))) (e . (car (cdr x)))).
