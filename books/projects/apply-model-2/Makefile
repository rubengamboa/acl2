# Target "all" is the top target of Makefile-generic.  We avoid
# including Makefile-subdirs or Makefile-psubdirs because we want to
# be sure to control the order: first this directory, then
# subdirectories.

# At one time we had something like this:

# top: all
# 	$(MAKE) all-subdirs
# all-subdirs: ex1 ex2

# However, I (Matt K.) started seeing surprising (to me) dependency
# errors, perhaps due to some change in GNU Make around version 4.1.
# So now I take care to ensure that all books in the current directory
# are certified before certification is attempted in the
# subdirectories and, moreover, those subdirectories are done
# sequentially (to avoid the parallel recertification of
# e.g. apply-prim.lisp in the present directory on behalf of ex1/ and
# ex2/).
