This is the README file for /books/projects/apply-model-2/ex2/.  This directory
is almost analogous to its peer, ../ex1/ and you should see the README file
there for details.  The ``almost'' is necessary because this directory contains
one more file, user-thms.lisp, which just illustrates more theorems about
scions.  Some of these theorems are also in ../report.lisp but a few are novel.

Certification instructions for this directory are analogous to those for ex1/
as described in the README but bear repeating:

Certification of books in this directory depends on the following.

cp -p ../apply.lisp evaluation-apply.lisp
cp -p user-defs.lisp evaluation-user-defs.lisp

That is done automatically using "make", or by running a regression
from the top-level ACL2 directory or books/.

Running "make" in this directory, however, will not guarantee that the
books in the parent directory are certified, which is necessary.
Either run make in the parent directory or run cert.pl with option
--include-excludes in either directory _after_ copying as shown above.
