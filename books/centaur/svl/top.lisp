;; All the books from SVL package.

;; This book has a Verilog simulation tool: SVL

;; SVL creates an occ listener structure that is used to order occurances such
;; that when run in order will give the correct Verilog simulation result.  The
;; code is deemed stable. Also SVL supports a flattening functionality for
;; sub-modules. In case of a combinational loop, the program will throw an
;; error at the time of translation from SV design to SVL design.

 :long "
<p>Similar to @(see sv::svtv), SVL semantics is converted from @(see acl2::sv)
 to simulate Verilog designs but it can retain design hierarchy by not
 flattening and composing selected modules. It supports combinational and
 sequential circuits but it fails in case of combinational loops.
</p>

<p> You need @(see acl2::VL) and @(see acl2::SV) designs to create SVL
designs. You can use functions svl::svl-flatten-design to create SVL design,
and svl::svl-run to run the generated design.</p>
