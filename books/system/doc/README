This directory supports building an ACL2 manual with the XDOC system.
However, instead of opening the resulting manual/index.html in your
browser, you might prefer to open the combined manual, which includes
documentation not only for the ACL2 system but also for the ACL2
community books.  The ACL2 home page has instructions for downloading
that manual.

Most users should not need to read further, or even think about this
directory.  In particular, to view the ACL2 User's Manual in a web
browser, simply open the file doc/home-page.html that is distributed
with ACL2.  If you are using an svn distribution, you may wish to
update the documentation by standing in the top-level ACL2 directory
and issuing the following command, where <my-acl2h> is the path to a
CCL-based ACL2(h) executable: make DOC ACL2=<my-acl2h>.

..........

This directory contains files that allow you to produce the following:

manual/                     ; ACL2 manual as an XDOC document
rendered-doc.lsp            ; ACL2 manual as ACL2 source file doc.lisp

Here is how to rebuild manual/, which is the ACL2 XDOC manual, where
the first step is optional:

  ../../build/clean.pl
  rm -rf manual acl2-manual.cert rendered-doc.lsp
  ../../build/cert.pl acl2-manual --acl2 <your_acl2>

To rebuild ACL2 source file doc.lisp to reflect the current contents
of acl2-doc.lisp:

  rm -f rendered-doc.lsp
  ../../build/cert.pl render-doc.lisp --acl2 <your_acl2>
  cp -p rendered-doc.lsp ../../../doc.lisp

Alternatively, you may accomplish both of the above by standing in the
ACL2 development directory, building ACL2, and then running:

  make DOC ACL2=<your_acl2>

Permanent contents of this directory:

README                      ; this file
acl2-customization.lsp
acl2-doc.lisp               ; ACL2 documentation (in XDOC format)
acl2-manual.lisp            ; certification creates manual/
cert.acl2
render-doc.lisp             ; certification creates rendered-doc.lsp
tool.tgz                    ; see below
unversioned-files-extra.txt ; svn support (see ../../README-svn)

File tool.tgz contains files that were used to create the initial
version of acl2-doc.lisp.  Moving forward, acl2-doc.lisp is to be
modified by hand by the ACL2 community (specifically, by members of
the acl2-books project).
