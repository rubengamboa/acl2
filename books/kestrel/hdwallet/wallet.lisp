   (xdoc::h3 "Overview")

   (xdoc::p
    "This wallet is a simple proof of concept:
     it is not meant as a product
     to use with keys that control access to significant assets.
     Nonetheless, due to its formal basis in the ACL2 theorem prover,
     it could serve as a starting point for
     a high-assurance wallet product.")

   (xdoc::p
    "This wallet is meant for use on an air-gapped machine.
     It provides two basic functions: key generation and transaction signing.
     Thus, keys can be generated and used for signing transacions:
     the data of the transaction to sign and the signed transaction
     must be passed between the air-gapped machine where this wallet runs
     and an Internet-connected machine that submits the signed transactions.
     The private keys never leave the air-gapped machine.
     Currently, the wallet does not encrypt these keys, which are stored in
     plaintext in the file system: therefore, the air-gapped machine should
     use disk encryption to protect the keys at rest.
     Currently keys and transactions only for the Ethereum mainnet are supported.")

   (xdoc::p
    "The wallet is hierarchical deterministic, according to "
    (xdoc::seetopic "bitcoin::bip32" "BIP 32")
    ". It uses a mnemonic word sequence according to "
    (xdoc::seetopic "bitcoin::bip39" "BIP 39")
    ". Its internal structure is compliant with "
    (xdoc::seetopic "bitcoin::bip43" "BIP 43")
    " and "
    (xdoc::seetopic "bitcoin::bip44" "BIP 44")
    ".")

   (xdoc::p
    "The wallet can be run by a command line interface shell script
     that runs a Docker image containing the wallet code.
     For details on obtaining, installing, and running the wallet see "

      :href "https://github.com/acl2/acl2/tree/master/books/kestrel/hdwallet/README.md"
      "the README in GitHub")
     ". The following is a technical discussion of the current wallet design.")

   (xdoc::h3 "State")

   (xdoc::p
    "The state of the wallet consists of zero or more private keys
     derived from a seed as in BIP 32.
     The seed is derived from an entropy value, or a corresponding mnemonic,
     as in BIP 39.
     Internally, each key has a path of the form")

    (xdoc::li

      as prescribed by "
     (xdoc::a

       "SLIP (Satoshi Labs Improvement Proposal) 44")
     ". This wallet currently supports
      transactions only for the Ethereum mainnet,
      as mentioned above.")
    (xdoc::li
     "@('0\'') is the default account index, according to BIP 44.
      The wallet currently supports only this default account.")
    (xdoc::li
     "@('0') is the external chain index, according to BIP 44.
      For Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin,
      there should be no need for an internal chain index,
      since transactions involve no change back to the payer.")
    (xdoc::li
     "@('address_index') is an address index 0, 1, 2, ...
      Each of these has an associated Ethereum account and address."))
   (xdoc::p
    "Thus, the BIP 32 key tree in the wallet consists of
     a ``line'' from the root key to the external chain key,
     with zero or more children under that.")

   (xdoc::p
    "The state of the wallet also includes a counter
     for the number of address indices used so far.
     This is normally one above the largest address index in the key tree,
     except for the rare cases in which an address key derivation fails
     and that index must be skipped.
     This counter is normally redundant, but not always.")

   (xdoc::h3 "Initialization")

   (xdoc::p
    "The wallet provides two commands to initialize the wallet.
     The first command initializes the wallet
     from an entropy value and a passphrase,
     as described in BIP 39.
     Besides creating the initial key tree (initially without address keys),
     this command also outputs the mnemonic corresponding to the entropy value.
     This may be used by the second initialization command
     to reconstruct (i.e. re-initialize) the wallet,
     from the mnemonic and the passphrase,
     also as described in BIP 39.")

   (xdoc::p
    "It is expected that the user will initially use the first initialization command,
     and use the second initialization command only if and when the wallet must be re-created.
     The wallet currently does not provide facilities
     to generate a securely random entropy:
     the user must use external means for that,
     and pass the entropy to the wallet.")

   (xdoc::p
    "In rare cases, the initialization of the wallet from entropy and passphrase
     may fail, due to the failure to derive some key
     on the ``line'' from the root (master) key to the external chain key.
     In this case, the user must try again
     with a slightly different entropy or passphrase.
     Obviously,
     if a particular entropy and passphrase succeed in creating the wallet
     with the first initialization command,
     then the mnemonic corresponding to that entropy and the same passphrase
     will also succeed in creating the same wallet
     using the second initialization command.")

   (xdoc::h3 "Key Generation")

   (xdoc::p
    "Once the wallet is initialized as explained above,
     the user must create one or more address keys
     in order to sign transactions (see below).
     The wallet provides a command to generate the next address key,
     namely the key whose index is the aforementioned counter
     that is part of the wallet state along with the key tree.
     Since the counter is initially 0,
     the first address key to be generated is the one with index 0,
     then index 1, then index 2, etc.")

   (xdoc::p
    "Normally, the generation of an address key succeeds.
     In this case, besides modifying the internal state of the wallet,
     the command also outputs the index of the key
     (so that the user does not need to keep track of the counter,
     or next index),
     as well as the Ethereum address corresponding to the key.
     The address is derived from the public key
     (as explained in the Ethereum Yellow Paper),
     which is derived from the private key
     (as known in elliptic curve cryptography).")

   (xdoc::p
    "In rare cases, the generation of an address key may fail.
     In this case, the address index is simply skipped,
     and the counter (i.e. next key) is advanced
     so that the command can be tried again to generate the next key.")

   (xdoc::h3 "Transaction Signing")

   (xdoc::p
    "Once at least one address key has been generated
     (normally the one with index 0),
     the command to sign transactions can be used.
     The index of the address key to use for the signature
     is passed to the signing command by the user.")

   (xdoc::p
    "The signing command also takes as inputs
     the following components of the transaction
     (see the Ethereum Yellow Paper for details):")
   (xdoc::ul
    (xdoc::li
     "The nonce associated to the Ethereum address.
      This is stored in the state of the Ethereum network,
      but since this wallet is air-gapped,
      the user must keep track of the nonce,
      and supply it to the signing command.")
    (xdoc::li
     "The gas price for processing the transaction.
      This is under the user's discretion.")
    (xdoc::li
     "The gas limit for processing the transaction.
      This should be accurately estimated by the user,
      plausibly with the aid of some tools external to the wallet.")
    (xdoc::li
     "The recipient address.
      The address may be that of a contract
      or of an externally owned account;
      the wallet supports both.")
    (xdoc::li
     "The value to transmit to the recipient, in Wei.")
    (xdoc::li
     "The data (a sequence of bytes) to pass to the recipient.
      This makes sense when the recipient is a contract,
      as opposed to an externally owned account."))

   (xdoc::p
    "The command outputs the bytes of the signed transaction, RLP-encoded.
     This is the form in which the transaction
     must be submitted to the Ethereum network.
     Since this wallet is air-gapped,
     the user must copy the output of this command
     and use an Internet-connected machine
     to actually submit the transaction.")

   (xdoc::p
    "In rare cases, the signing of the transaction may fail.
     Since the elliptic curve signature scheme used by this wallet
     is deterministic,
     re-trying the same command will fail again.
     Instead, the user could try to change slightly
     some non-critical component of the transaction,
     such as the gas limit.")

   (xdoc::h3 "Persistence")

   (xdoc::p
    "This wallet runs in ``batch'' mode:
     each command starts up the wallet,
     which terminates at the end of the command.
     The state of the wallet must be therefore stored persistently,
     in a file in the file system.
     The ACL2 constant @(tsee *stat-filepath*) holds the path to this file:
     it is currently set to a relative path in this directory,
     but it can be easily changed of course.")

   (xdoc::p
    "Currently the file stores the wallet state in plaintext,
     i.e. not encrypted.
     Future versions of the wallet will likely use AES encryption.
     However, recall that this wallet is meant for an air-gapped machine:
     at rest, the wallet state can be protected by disk encryption.
     Thus, even if the machine is stolen,
     it should not be possible to recover the wallet state,
     assuming that the disk encryption is protected by a  strong password.")

   (xdoc::h3 "Error Handling")

   (xdoc::p
    "The wallet carefully validates all the user inputs
     and provides informative error messages when the inputs are invalid.
     The wallet also provides informative error messages
     when some internal cryptographic operation fails
     due to a rare but possible event (as mentioned above).
     There is just one exception to this approach to error handling:
     in order to load/save the wallet state from/to the file,
     the wallet implementation uses ACL2's
     @(tsee serialize-read) and @(tsee serialize-write),
     which may throw hard errors in some cases.
     Thus, it is currently possible, but hopefully rare,
     to get an ACL2 hard error from the wallet."))

(fty::defprod stat

  :long
  "<p>
   The state of the wallet includes a BIP 32 key tree.
   </p>
   <p>
   The key tree will always include:
   the purpose key (44') just under the root key;
   the Ethereum mainnet coin type key (60') just under that;
   the default account key (0') just under that;
   the external chain key (0) just under that;
   and 0 or more address keys just under that.
   In rare cases, some address key may be missing
   (when their derivation fails);
   see BIP 32 for details.
   Thus, every key in the tree is identified by a path of the following form:
   </p>
   @({
     m / 44' / 60' / 0' / 0 / address_index
   })
   <p>
   The state of the wallet also includes
   the number of address keys derived so far.
   More precisely, this is the number of address keys
   attempted to derive so far,
   since in rare cases key derivation may fail (see BIP 32).
   </p>
   <p>
   Because of this rare eventuality,
   this additional state component (the number of addresses)
   is not always redundant with the key tree,
   i.e. it cannot always be derived from the key tree.
   For example, the user may have attempted to derive 10 address keys,
   with indices 0 to 9, all of which were successful
   except for the one with index 9.
   Then the key tree would have 9 address keys (with indices 0 to 8),
   and no key for index 9.
   However, the additional state component for the number of addresses
   would be 10 in this case, and not 9.
   In this way, the next address key derivation attempt can be made
   at index 10, and not again at index 9 (which would fail again).
   </p>
   <p>
   This fixtype captures the basic structure of the state of the wallet.
   Additional constraints, including the ones outlined above,
   are expressed by the well-formedness predicate @(tsee stat-wfp).
