   (xdoc::h3 "Approach")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ is supported by "
    (xdoc::seetopic "aij" "AIJ")
    ", which is a deep embedding in Java
     of the executable subset of ACL2
     (subject to the limitations outlined above).")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ translates the target ACL2 functions into Java representations,
     based on their unnormalized bodies or attachments.
     It does so recursively,
     starting from the top-level functions specified by the user
     and stopping at the ACL2 functions that
     either are implemented natively in AIJ
     or (under certain conditions; see below)
     represent Java primitive operations or primitive array operations.
     If a function is encountered that
     is not natively implemented in AIJ
     and has no unnormalized body and no attachment,
     ATJ stops with an error.
     If a function is encountered that has raw Lisp code
     and is not in the whitelist
     (except for the treament of @(tsee return-last) explained above),
     ATJ stops with an error.")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ generates Java code with public methods to
     (1) initialize the AIJ's Java representation of the ACL2 environment and
     (2) call the Java representations of the ACL2 functions
     on Java representations of ACL2 values
     (see the `Generated Java Code' section for details).
     AIJ provides public classes and methods to translate
     certain Java values to AIJ's Java representations of ACL2 values
     and vice versa.
     Thus, by loading into the Java Virtual Machine
     both AIJ and the Java code generated by ATJ,
     external Java code can ``use'' ACL2 code.")

   (xdoc::p
    "ATJ generates either deeply embedded or shallowly embedded
     Java representations of the ACL2 functions.
     The choice is controlled by a user option.")

   (xdoc::h4 "Deep Embedding")

   (xdoc::p
    "In the deep embedding approach,
     ATJ generates Java code to build
     the deeply embedded ACL2 functions,
     and to call and execute them via AIJ's interpreter.")

   (xdoc::p
    "This deep embedding approach is simple and thus fairly high-assurance.
     On the other hand, the Java code is not efficient or idiomatic.
     However, the approach may work well for some simple applications.")

   (xdoc::h4 "Shallow Embedding")

   (xdoc::p
    "In the shallow embedding approach,
     ATJ generates Java code that mimics the computations of
     the shallowly embedded ACL2 functions,
     one Java method for each ACL2 function.
     These methods are executed without using AIJ's interpreter.
     However, the shallowly embedded ACL2 functions still use
     AIJ's representation of the ACL2 values
     and AIJ's native implementations of ACL2 functions.
     Under certain conditions,
     the shallowly embedded ACL2 functions use Java values
     that are not AIJ's Java representations of ACL2 values:
     in particular, they use Java primitive types;
     see below for details.")

   (xdoc::p
    "This shallow embedding approach
     is more complex than the deep embedding approach,
     but produces code that is more efficient and more idiomatic.")
