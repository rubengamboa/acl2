# This file runs the tests for the Java code generated by ATJ,
# collecting and printing time measurements for some of them.

# The -Xss1G option to the JVM sets the stack size to 1GB.
# This is generally needed to avoid a stack overflow,
# because AIJ's recursive evaluation uses much more stack space
# than typical Java programs.

# This file assumes that OpenJDK Java 13 is in the path,
# but it may well work with other Java versions or implementations.
