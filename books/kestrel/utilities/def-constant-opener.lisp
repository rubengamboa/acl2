(in-package "ACL2")

;; This book contains a utility that generates an opener theorem for a function
;; call where the rule fires only when all of the function's arguments are
;; constants.  This can be helpful when the function's executable-counterpart
;; is disabled.  The Axe tool also makes extensive use of def-constant-opener.

;; See also the defopeners tool.  One difference is that defopeners makes a
;; separate rule for each IF branch of the function, whereas
;; def-constant-opener makes a single rule but expects all IF tests to be
;; resolved since all of the arguments are constants.  Another difference is
;; that def-constant-opener can use the untranslated function body -- which is
;; a bit nicer -- since it doesn't have to analyze the body.

;; See also the tool in books/misc/defopener.  That tool also
;; does simplification.

;; See def-constant-opener-tests.lisp for some tests of this utility.

;; TODO: Add support for mutual-recursion.
