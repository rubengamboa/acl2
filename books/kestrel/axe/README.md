The Axe Toolkit
===============================

This directory is a placeholder for the Axe toolkit, which we are
currently open sourcing, starting with its supporting libraries, some
of which are already available (see books/kestrel/arithmetic-light/,
books/kestrel/lists-light/, and books/kestrel/bv/).

For more information, see the [Axe Webpage][Axe].
