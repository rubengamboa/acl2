(defstobj td ; termination database

; WARNING: Keep this in sync with td-reset.

; Our termination database stores termination clause-lists, each of them
; simplified a bit ("normalized").

; This database is represented by a stobj, td, with two array fields:

; - td-entry-ar: Each array element is a td-entry record, which consists of a
;   clause-list (as described above) and other information; see td-entry.  The
;   index of that entry (record) is called its "ID".  We may also refer to fn
;   as the "root" of the entry and, of course, we may also refer to the
;   clause-list of all-fns of the entry.

; - fns: Each entry is an alist, where each key is a logic-mode function
;   symbol, which is mapped to the list of all indices (IDs) of td-entry
;   records whose clause-list has at least one occurrence of that function
;   symbol.

; The stobj also has a next-index value, which is the first index that has
; never been used for td-entry-ar, initially 0.  It also has a "free list" of
; indices that are available because their entries have been essentially
; deleted.

; Each time the database is queried with a new function and corresponding
; termination clause-list, one of three things happens, as follows.

; - If the given clause-list is subsumed by a clause-list of an entry in the
;   database, then the root function of that entry is returned.

; NOTE: if we prefer not to update the database, for example because we do not
; want to return it, then we can stop here, returning nil to indicate failure.

; - Else if a clause-list of an entry subsumes the given clause-list, then the
;   database is updated: the entry is updated using the new function and
;   clause-list.

; - Otherwise a new entry is created for the given function and clause-list.

; WARNING: We assume that the initial value of fns-length-shifted, currently
; 16000, is (ash n (- *fns-length-shift*)) where n is the common dimension of
; td-entry-ar and fns, which is 1000 below.
