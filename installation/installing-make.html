<H1>Installing Make</A></H1>

We have seen problems with Version 3.81 of GNU make on Linux (though
not on a Mac).  (And in builds with Allegro Common Lisp on 32-bit
Linux we have seen problems with GNU make version 3.80 that seemed to
be solved with version 3.81.)

<p>

Here are instructions for installing Version 3.80 of GNU make on linux
that worked for us.  (Note: We have both 32-bit and 64-bit OS machines
on your filesystem, and after we did the following on a 32-bit
machine, we could use make 3.80 on either 32-bit or 64-bit machines.)

<ol>

<li>
Change to a directory under which you will put make 3.80:
<pre>
mkdir Make
cd Make
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Download GNU make version 3.80 from:<p>
<code><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/make-3.80.tar.gz">http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/make-3.80.tar.gz</a></code><p>
</li>

<li>
Extract/build/install:
<pre>
tar xfz make-3.80.tar.gz
cd make-3.80
./configure
make
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Arrange that the new make 3.80 is your default make.  For example, if
~/bin at (or sufficiently near) the front of your <code>PATH</code>
and <code>DIR</code> is the directory in which you downloaded
<code>make-3.80.tar.gz</code> as above, you can do this:
<pre>
ln -s DIR/Make/make-3.80/make make
rehash
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Test that you have installed make 3.80 as your default make.  The
following should print "<code>GNU Make 3.80</code>".
<pre>
make --version
</pre>
</li>

</ol>
